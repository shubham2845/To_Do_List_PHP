The homepage you've created using PHP features three distinct sections, each serving a specific purpose. When you access the homepage, you're greeted with these options:

Home Button: By clicking on the "Home" button, you will be redirected to the main home page. This section provides a central hub for users to return to, where they can access the different functionalities your website offers.

Add Details: Clicking on the "Add Details" option allows users to input and store new records. This feature enables users to enter relevant information, such as tasks or events, and have them saved for future reference. It's a convenient way to keep track of important data.

To-Do List: The "To-Do List" section presents users with a comprehensive view of all the details they need to manage. By clicking on this option, users can access a list that displays the records they've entered using the "Add Details" feature. This functionality assists users in staying organized and on top of their tasks.

Add List
When you select the "Add Details" option from the homepage, you're directed to a dedicated page designed to facilitate the process of inputting your information. On this page, you'll encounter a user-friendly form that prompts you to enter various details, including your to-do list items along with their corresponding dates and times.

Within this form, you have the opportunity to create a structured list of tasks or events that you need to manage. Each entry requires not only the description of the task but also the date and time when it's scheduled. This additional layer of organization helps you prioritize and plan your activities effectively.

By providing this comprehensive form, the website empowers you to seamlessly add and record the tasks that require your attention. Whether it's appointments, deadlines, or personal reminders, this feature ensures that all essential information is captured accurately, ensuring a smooth and organized workflow.

Once you've successfully added all the necessary details through the "Add Details" form, you gain the ability to access and review your compiled to-do list. When you choose the "To-Do List" option from the homepage, the website guides you to a designated page where all your recorded tasks and events are neatly displayed.

On this dedicated "To-Do List" page, you'll find a comprehensive overview of all the details you've entered. This presentation empowers you to have a clear visual representation of the tasks and their corresponding dates and times, enabling you to effectively manage your commitments.

Moreover, the functionality extends beyond mere visualization. You're given two distinct options:

Update: If you need to modify any aspect of a particular task, such as changing the description, date, or time, the "Update" option allows you to seamlessly make these adjustments. This adaptability ensures that your to-do list remains accurate and up-to-date, reflecting any changes in your plans.

Delete: In case a task is completed or no longer relevant, the "Delete" option lets you effortlessly remove it from your list. This maintains the relevance and cleanliness of your to-do list, ensuring that you're focused on the tasks that truly matter.
