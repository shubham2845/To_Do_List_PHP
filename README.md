The homepage you've created using PHP features three distinct sections, each serving a specific purpose. When you access the homepage, you're greeted with these options:

Home Button: By clicking on the "Home" button, you will be redirected to the main home page. This section provides a central hub for users to return to, where they can access the different functionalities your website offers.

Add Details: Clicking on the "Add Details" option allows users to input and store new records. This feature enables users to enter relevant information, such as tasks or events, and have them saved for future reference. It's a convenient way to keep track of important data.

To-Do List: The "To-Do List" section presents users with a comprehensive view of all the details they need to manage. By clicking on this option, users can access a list that displays the records they've entered using the "Add Details" feature. This functionality assists users in staying organized and on top of their tasks.
